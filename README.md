# Udacity-Facial-Keypoints-Detection

## Project Overview

In this project, we build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.

Facial keypoints displayed on two images, each of which contains a single face.


## Project Instructions

The project is broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
